# Character Simulation Simplifications

## What Changed

### Before (Complex)
- Main jobs could be any level 1-99
- Complex per-level stat growth calculations
- Job traits activated based on character level
- Only main jobs got job point and master level bonuses
- Subjobs were limited and couldn't have master levels

### After (Simplified)
- **Main jobs are always level 99** - no more level calculations
- **Fixed stat bonuses** per job instead of per-level scaling
- **All job traits are active** since main jobs are level 99
- **Both main and subjobs can have master levels** with scaling
- **Both main and subjobs get job point bonuses** if mastered (with multipliers)

## Benefits of Simplification

1. **Easier to Use**: Players don't need to manage job levels for main jobs
2. **Faster Calculations**: No complex level-based math
3. **More Realistic**: Most endgame FFXI players have level 99 main jobs anyway
4. **Better Subjob Support**: Subjobs can now have master levels and contribute more meaningfully
5. **Cleaner Code**: Removed complex level-scaling logic

## Impact on Existing System

- ✅ **No database changes needed** - existing CharacterJob model still works
- ✅ **API remains compatible** - same endpoints and request/response format
- ✅ **Gear integration unchanged** - still works with existing gear sets
- ✅ **Job configurations work better** - all traits are now active

## New Behavior Examples

### WAR/THF Example:
- **Main Job**: WAR level 99, ML 25
  - Gets fixed level 99 stat bonuses (STR +50, VIT +50)
  - Gets ALL job traits (Attack Bonus, Double Attack, etc.)
  - Gets full job point bonuses if mastered
  - Gets 50% of master level bonuses (25/50)

- **Subjob**: THF level 45, ML 10  
  - Gets scaled level stats (45/99 * base) * 0.5 subjob penalty
  - Gets traits for levels 1-45 * 0.5 subjob penalty
  - Gets 50% job point bonuses if mastered
  - Gets 20% of master level bonuses (10/50 * 0.5)

## Configuration Impact

Job configurations are now simpler:
- No need for complex level-based trait activation
- All traits are available immediately for main jobs
- Cleaner stat bonus definitions
- Better scaling for subjobs

This makes the system much more maintainable while being more representative of actual FFXI endgame play patterns.
